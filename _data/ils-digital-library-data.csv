coll001,,,,,Medieval Paleography Resources,,500-1500,yes,"Medieval Paleography is the study of historical handwriting from the medieval period, roughly spanning the 5th to the 15th centuries. It involves analyzing, deciphering, and dating scripts used in handwritten documents such as manuscripts, charters, and archival records. Scholars of medieval paleography examine letterforms, writing materials, abbreviations, and scribal practices to understand how writing styles evolved over time and across regions. The discipline is essential for interpreting original texts, tracing the transmission of knowledge, and reconstructing the cultural and administrative history of the Middle Ages.","Paleography, Medieval; Manuscripts, Medieval; Codicology; Historical Scripts; Latin Paleography; Gothic Script; Handwriting — Medieval Period",,,,,,,,,record,compound_object,eng,,,
