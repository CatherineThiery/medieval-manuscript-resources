description: The Digital Library of Medieval Manuscript Resources is dedicated to promoting the exploration, study, and appreciation of medieval manuscript culture by providing access to publicly available online collections of digitized manuscripts, as well as trusted educational resources on medieval paleography and codicology. The increasing digitization of medieval manuscripts over the past 25 years has made these rare and fragile artifacts more widely accessible, allowing scholars, educators, and enthusiasts to engage with them in new ways. Rather than serving as a comprehensive repository, this digital library functions as a curated gateway, directing users to premier external collections and educational materials.
